Get started:

- create your own repo (for example on www.github.com)
- change the origin to your own repo with `git remote set-url origin <remote_url>`
- run `npm i` to install all dependencies
- change directory to whatever tech suites you best
- run `npm run migrate`
- run `npm run test` (1 test should succeed and 3 should fail)

Good luck! 🍀🚀
