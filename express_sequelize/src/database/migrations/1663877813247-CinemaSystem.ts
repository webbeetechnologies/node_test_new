   # ToDo: Create a migration that creates all tables for the following user stories

   For an example on how a UI for an api using this might look like, please try to book a show at https://in.bookmyshow.com/.
   To not introduce additional complexity, please consider only one cinema.

   Please list the tables that you would create including keys, foreign keys and attributes that are required by the user stories.

   ## User Stories

   **Movie exploration**
   * As a user I want to see which films can be watched and at what times
   * As a user I want to only see the shows which are not booked out

   **Show administration**
   * As a cinema owner I want to run different films at different times
   * As a cinema owner I want to run multiple films at the same time in different showrooms

   **Pricing**
   * As a cinema owner I want to get paid differently per show
   * As a cinema owner I want to give different seat types a percentage premium, for example 50 % more for vip seat

   **Seating**
   * As a user I want to book a seat
   * As a user I want to book a vip seat/couple seat/super vip/whatever
   * As a user I want to see which seats are still available
   * As a user I want to know where I'm sitting on my ticket
   * As a cinema owner I don't want to configure the seating for every show
